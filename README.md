# Welcome to my (relatively empty) profile!

My name is Thiago, and I'm a computer science student (graduating soon) who works mostly in the field of Computer Graphics. Currently doing research (or trying to, anyway) on tensor product surfaces for my senior thesis.

As a hobby, I also made a few graphical applications, and both are featured in my pinned repos down below. One is a very basic game engine, and the other is a full fledged path tracer (I mean, it's not Blender, but it's something at least). Below is a pretty little image I made with the latter.

And that's about it for my dev career... for now, I hope.
